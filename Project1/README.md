We chose to display all of the initial condition combinations on the same graph.
The graphs are grouped by solver.
We are confused on how to implement sinusoidal torque. We will be going to office hours.

## Week 1 Feedback (5/5): 
Great job! Keep it up for week 2, you're on the right track! 
The one thing I want to say is to consider adding some sort of logic (either in MATLAB script or Simulink model) to determine whether the applied torque is constant or sinusoidal as this will change inputs to determine applied torque. 
Also, make sure to use proper axis in the future (aka Having Time on the x axis) in your plots
